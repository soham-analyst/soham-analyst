# 💫 About Me:
🔭 I’m currently working on Real-world data analytics projects (SQL, Python, Tableau) focused on business insights, not tutorial nonsense.<br>👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Data analysis projects that solve actual problems — dashboards, EDA, KPI tracking, automation. If it’s vague or academic-only, I’m not interested.<br>🤝 I’m looking for help with Code reviews, project feedback, and improving analysis depth (storytelling > charts).<br>🌱 I’m currently learning Advanced SQL, Python for analytics, statistics, and better dashboard design that decision-makers actually use.<br>💬 Ask me about SQL queries, Tableau dashboards, data cleaning, and turning messy data into clear insights.<br>⚡ Fun fact I care more about why the numbers change than making dashboards look “pretty.”
